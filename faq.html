  <h1>Wear The WORD?<h1>
  <h2>Yeah really,why should I? I am just tryna keep a low profile.</h2>
  <p>Well,</p>
  <p>Dear Christian Bro/Sis,</p>
  <blockquote>Our LORD Jesus Christ commanded us to spread the Good News of salvation.<strong>Mark 16:15-16.</strong>We have a task at hand that is tideous and scary but we know that nothing compares to the glory awaiting us in heaven.<br/>
  <strong>Daniel 12:3</strong> says <q>Those who are wise will shine as bright as the sky and those who turn many to righteousness will shine like stars forever.</q></blockquote>
  <p class="christiandream">It is every Faithful Christian's dream to receive the words<strong>"Well done good and faithful servant."</strong></p>
  <blockquote> I get it,not all have a calling to evangelism or maybe you're an introvert or maybe you just don't know how and where to start...<br/>
  Be strong and of good courage for you must know we are all commissioned to spread The Word and enjoy the benefits.<br/>
  Do it any way you can.
  So why not start by speaking through your wears?<br/>
  Remember...
  <strong>Romans16:25,"GOD is able to make you strong just as the Good News says."</strong></blockquote>
